<h2>How to make an Angular project</h2>

First, this cheat-sheet is for people working on a Linux environment.

<h3>1 - Install Angular CLI</h3>

Install the Angular CLI by using the npm package manager:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

<h3>2 - Create the initial base of an Angular project</h3>

After installing your Angular Cli, you will finally be able to create the beginnings of the creation of your first Angular project.

To start with, you will have to create your Angular project :

`ng new mon-application-angular`

This line of code is the so-called classic way to create an Angular project.

There is also a command that allows you to create an Angular project, however, you create it using SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets):

`ng new mon-application-angular --style=scss`

<h3>3 - Test your project</h3>



<h3>4 - Create your first component in your project</h3>


<h3>5 - Root the component</h3>


<h3>6 - Check the rooting if it's working</h3>
